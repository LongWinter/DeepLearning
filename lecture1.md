# Deep Learning ==> Neural Networks in Computer Vision

### introduction to deep learning

- what is learning?
  - improving performance through experience
  - Getting a computer to do well on a task without manually building in competence
- what is deep?

  - learning using multi-layer neural networks

- Deep learning is especially good for untructured data (image text xpeech etc), less os for structured data (spread sheet, tables)

  - dominant in vision, speech; largely popular in NLP

- Showing promise in many other fields, but still lots of barreirs to overcome

  - standard machine learning techniques works pretty good compared with deep learning approaches

- there are a lot of engineering hacks, lots of trail and error.
